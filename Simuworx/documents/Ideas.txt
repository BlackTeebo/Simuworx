Simuworx Ideas

Simuworx is planned to be a flexible, highly extensible, network aware framework
to master simulation tasks in various aspects.

Possible ways to use the framework could be:
- test parts of your micro controller code for example to test reactions on 
  changes of inputs. Why don't you simulate your debouncing strategy before
  you flash it to your controller?
- test behaviour of your rulesystem depending of various inputs!
- use simulation accross your network to have a distributed simulation environment
  for multiple tasks
- ... more ideas? Realize them!
